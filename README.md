This work aims to predict EV Charging Stations' location & Load Info based on a designed Temporal-Graph-JEPA by formulating a Graph combining Road and Grid.

This shall be the FIRST research on designing T-Graph-JEPA and its application in the Road & Grid field.

Still working on...

Anyone Interested in this T-Graph-JEPA, please contact me through nzy0720@sjtu.edu.cn...
