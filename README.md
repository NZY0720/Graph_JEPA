This work aims to predict EV Charging Stations' location & Load Info based on a designed Graphormer-JEPA by formulating a Graph combining Road and Grid.

This shall be the FIRST research on designing Graphormer-JEPA and its application in the Road & Grid field.

Still working on...

Anyone Interested in this Graphormer-JEPA, please contact me through nzy0720@sjtu.edu.cn...

Future work would be formulating a Temporal-Graph-JEPA.
